- pricing model: by percentage / use default price field / pricelist module
- split bundle into separate items during order placement
- split bundle option configurable per each product variation bundle entity
- show saving amount / percentage with new adjustment type - `bundle_saving`
- integration with commerce_stock - dynamically set stock based on bundle

This module requires Drupal Commerce Core >= 2.30

## Installation

Install the Commerce Variation Bundle module as you would normally install
any Drupal contrib module.

2. Create new product and product variation type.
